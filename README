An attempt to organise my vim files


INSTALLATION

1. Clone the repo to ~/.vim (if haven't done already)
    
    git clone http://github.com/tranngocthachs/dotvim ~/.vim

2. Symlink .vimrc and .gvimrc

    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc 

    ln -s ~/.vim/.gvimrc ~/.gvimrc 

1. Install Vundle with

    git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git bundle/vundle
    
assuming pwd is ~/.vim

2. Run Vim and type :BundleInstall to install the plugins with Vundle. Ignore
complaints about colorscheme since none has been installed yet. After running
:BundleInstall one shouldn't see this error anymore.
